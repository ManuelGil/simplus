Full-Stack Developer, DevSecOps Culture - merging technology and security to exceed expectations.

I am a programmer with two years of experience, passionate about functional programming and committed to the DevSecOps culture. I have skills in technologies such as Next.js for front-end development, Spring Boot to improve my back-end skills and Kubernetes (k8s) for efficient management of containerized applications. My love for programming transcends my professional life, dedicating my free time to learn and experiment with new technologies and techniques.
