This podcast began with the dream of creating a high impact community in the IT area, the architects of this idea are three programmers (Manuel Gil, Marco Mireles and Santiago Rey), who saw in the podcast format a tool to contribute to the community directly with their experience, linking this format to as part of the community.

This podcast started at the end of the year 2021 and is done seasonally, the Podcasters talk about the most relevant news in the area of technology at that time, presented with a somewhat irreverent tone and always from the particular point of view of each of the members. This gives the podcast a fresh and modern format to have a good time.
