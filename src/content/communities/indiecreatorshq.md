We are building a community of Independent Creators 🛠️. The idea of this community is to be able to create several Side Projects together, and show the whole world that Hispanics have a lot of talent... that we are a sleeping giant, and that the time has come to wake it up. It is a community that grows day by day, and the initiative started by Serudda, who is sure that we are going to build great things together. If you are a creator, or you have the desire to start creating 🚀... you came to the right place, do not stay out of one of the future largest Hispanic communities in the world 🌎!

## 🍿 How can I be part of the community?
There are no requirements, just have a love (or at least curiosity) for creating 🛠️. So no matter your level of experience within the tech industry (junior, mid, senior, cto, etc.) or your current role or position (dev, designer, product manager, tester, etc.)... everyone is welcome, whether it's to collaborate in the Side Projects we build with the community, or simply learn from the process of creating a personal project, so you can start creating your own 🥳.

All you have to do is join our Discord, which we call "Our Operations Center"... everything happens in there: ideation, planning, doubts, questions, answers, launches, etc.
